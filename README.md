# minimal-benchmark-logs
This project was meant to document every *important* resource on the pc, with an 'N' seconds interval. It was a naive implementation. There are better ways to do the same thing with less footprint.
## Status
Deprecated! This was meant to log & track statistics system wide; however, I now know there are smarter ways to do the same thing, with greater granularity without straining the system by using this project. DO NOT USE!
